# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-Python
Gesture is a form of nonverbal communication which involves movement of a part of the body, especially the hand usually to express an idea. In a human interaction, we make use of speech, gestures and body movements to convey information. The human-computer interaction which makes use of input devices such as keyboard or mouse for communication lacks natural communication between humans and machines. For this purpose, it is important to develop applications or devices that support intuitive communication.This project proposes a novel vision based cursor control system, using hand gestures captured from a webcam. The system will allow the user to navigate the computer cursor using their hand and cursor functions, such as right and left clicks, will be performed using different hand gestures.
